# TUSCAN

`TUSCAN` is an R package that aims to perform tumor segmentation and classification analysis by constructing a spatial copy number profile. TUSCAN takes both the gene information from spatial transcriptomics data and the hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining image as input to improve the accuracy of tumor region identification.
